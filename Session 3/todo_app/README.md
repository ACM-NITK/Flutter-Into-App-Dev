Basic Todo App

## Getting Started

* Make sure to have flutter installed.
* Run `flutter pub get` in the `Session 3/todo_app` folder.
* Run `flutter packages pub run build_runner build` to generate `TypeAdapter` for `Todo` model.
* This repository already contains the generated `TypeAdapter`. You can delete `models/Todo.g.dart` and re-run the above command.
* Run the app by using `flutter run lib/main.dart` command. Run this command from `Session 3/todo_app` folder.
